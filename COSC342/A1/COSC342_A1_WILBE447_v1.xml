 <paragraph index="20" node_type="writer">Introduction</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="21" node_type="writer">The aim of this report is to perform experiments on the image stitching process specifcally the feature matching and homography estimation. First experiment we will compare two feature matchers used by OpenCV and second experiment vary the choice of RANSAC threshold used in homogrpahy estimation. Both experiemtn will be measuring the accuracy of the homography via the reprojection error. </paragraph>
 <paragraph index="23" node_type="writer">compare features of transformed to reference (reprojection error)</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="24" node_type="writer"> and inlier ratio to outlier</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="25" node_type="writer">^ used iamge for both</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="26" node_type="writer">Metric used for measuring homography accuracy: </paragraph>
 <paragraph index="27" node_type="writer">Reprojection Error, calculates the euclidean distance between transformed points in source image to points in destination image.  It measures how well the homography aligns the source and destination points. Based on the opencv source code. Same reprojection error used in findInliers() in ptsetreg.cpp and computeError in fundam.cpp used by opencv findHomography() in filtering by threshold.</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="31" node_type="writer">Both experiments used the same image dataset, it contains a mix of 3 scene types: Outdoor/Natural greenery, Exteriror scnes of buildings</paragraph>

 <paragraph index="44" node_type="writer">Explain what your experiment is, what data you are going to be using, what you will measure, and how this will answer your question or test your hypothesis. If there are some parts of your design (e.g. your set of test data) that are common to both of the experiments, then you can move that out to the front of the report.</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="46" node_type="writer">Results:</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="47" node_type="writer">Clearly present the results of your experiment. This is the place for charts, tables, etc. but don’t just present them without explanation. </paragraph>

 <paragraph index="147" node_type="writer">Final Remarks</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="148" node_type="writer">Draw together the two experiments and tell us what you’ve found from them in general. This is also a good place to suggest what the next steps will be. It is good to be honest about the limitations of your work, especially if you can see how to improve things in the future.</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="149" node_type="writer">Only 3 scene types although due to time constraints and not balalnced and not balanced within the pixel reoslutions. </paragraph>
 <paragraph index="150" node_type="writer">Also I resized alot of images to smaller reoslutiosn since the processing time was rather long with the 3000x4000 images with some images returning 100,000+ features</paragraph>
