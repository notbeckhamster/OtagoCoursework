Maria Sklodowska Was Born In Warsaw, In Congress Poland In The Russian Empire, On 7 November 1867, The Fifth And Youngest Child Of Well-known Teachers Bronislawa, Nee Boguska, And Wladyslaw Sklodowski. The Elder Siblings Of Maria Nicknamed Mania) Were Zofia (born 1862, Nicknamed Zosia), Jozef (born 1863, Nicknamed Jozio), Bronislawa (born 1865, Nicknamed Bronia) And Helena (born 1866, Nicknamed Hela). On Both The Paternal And Maternal Sides, The Family Had Lost Their Property And Fortunes Through Patriotic Involvements In Polish National Uprisings Aimed At Restoring Poland's Independence (the Most Recent Had Been The January Uprising Of 1863 - 65). This Condemned The Subsequent Generation, Including Maria And Her Elder Siblings, To A Difficult Struggle To Get Ahead In Life. Maria's Paternal Grandfather, Jozef Sklodowski, Had Been A Respected Teacher In Lublin, Where He Taught The Young Boleslaw Prus, Who Would Become A Leading Figure In Polish Literature. Wladyslaw Sklodowski Taught Mathematics And Physics, Subjects That Maria Was To Pursue, And Was Also Director Of Two Warsaw Gymnasia For Boys. After Russian Authorities Eliminated Laboratory Instruction From The Polish Schools, He Brought Much Of The Laboratory Equipment Home, And Instructed His Children In Its Use. He Was Eventually Fired By His Russian Supervisors For Pro-polish Sentiments, And Forced To Take Lower-paying Posts; The Family Also Lost Money On A Bad Investment, And Eventually Chose To Supplement Their Income By Lodging Boys In The House. Maria's Mother Bronislawa Operated A Prestigious Warsaw Boarding School For Girls; She Resigned From The Position After Maria Was Born. She Died Of Tuberculosis In May 1878, When Maria Was Ten Years Old. Less Than Three Years Earlier, Maria's Oldest Sibling, Zofia, Had Died Of Typhus Contracted From A Boarder. Maria's Father Was An Atheist; Her Mother A Devout Catholic. The Deaths Of Maria's Mother And Sister Caused Her To Give Up Catholicism And Become Agnostic. When She Was Ten Years Old, Maria Began Attending The Boarding School Of J. Sikorska; Next She Attended A Gymnasium For Girls, From Which She Graduated On 12 June 1883 With A Gold Medal. After A Collapse, Possibly Due To Depression, She Spent The Following Year In The Countryside With Relatives Of Her Father, And The Next Year With Her Father In Warsaw, Where She Did Some Tutoring. Unable To Enroll In A Regular Institution Of Higher Education Because She Was A Woman, She And Her Sister Bronislawa Became Involved With The Clandestine Flying University (sometimes Translated As Floating University), A Polish Patriotic Institution Of Higher Learning That Admitted Women Students. Maria Made An Agreement With Her Sister, Bronislawa, That She Would Give Her Financial Assistance During Bronislawa's Medical Studies In Paris, In Exchange For Similar Assistance Two Years Later. In Connection With This, Maria Took A Position As Governess: First As A Home Tutor In Warsaw; Then For Two Years As A Governess In Szczuki With A Landed Family, The Zorawskis, Who Were Relatives Of Her Father. While Working For The Latter Family, She Fell In Love With Their Son, Kazimierz Zorawski, A Future Eminent Mathematician. His Parents Rejected The Idea Of His Marrying The Penniless Relative, And Kazimierz Was Unable To Oppose Them. Maria's Loss Of The Relationship With Zorawski Was Tragic For Both. He Soon Earned A Doctorate And Pursued An Academic Career As A Mathematician, Becoming A Professor And Rector Of Krakow University. Still, As An Old Man And A Mathematics Professor At The Warsaw Polytechnic, He Would Sit Contemplatively Before The Statue Of Maria Sklodowska Which Had Been Erected In 1935 Before The Radium Institute That She Had Founded In 1932.
