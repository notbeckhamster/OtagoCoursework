Ernest Rutherford Was The Son Of James Rutherford, A Farmer, And His Wife Martha Thompson, Originally From Hornchurch, Essex, England. James Had Emigrated To New Zealand From Perth, Scotland, "to Raise A Little Flax And A Lot Of Children". Ernest Was Born At Brightwater, Near Nelson, New Zealand. His First Name Was Mistakenly Spelled 'earnest' When His Birth Was Registered. Rutherford's Mother Martha Thompson Was A Schoolteacher. He Studied At Havelock School And Then Nelson College And Won A Scholarship To Study At Canterbury College, University Of New Zealand, Where He Participated In The Debating Society And Played Rugby. After Gaining His Ba, Ma And Bsc, And Doing Two Years Of Research During Which He Invented A New Form Of Radio Receiver, In 1895 Rutherford Was Awarded An 1851 Research Fellowship From The Royal Commission For The Exhibition Of 1851, To Travel To England For Postgraduate Study At The Cavendish Laboratory, University Of Cambridge. He Was Among The First Of The 'aliens' (those Without A Cambridge Degree) Allowed To Do Research At The University, Under The Inspiring Leadership Of J. J. Thomson, Which Aroused Jealousies From The More Conservative Members Of The Cavendish Fraternity. With Thomson's Encouragement, He Managed To Detect Radio Waves At Half A Mile And Briefly Held The World Record For The Distance Over Which Electromagnetic Waves Could Be Detected, Though When He Presented His Results At The British Association Meeting In 1896, He Discovered He Had Been Outdone By Another Lecturer, By The Name Of Marconi. In 1898, Thomson Recommended Rutherford For A Position At Mcgill University In Montreal, Canada. He Was To Replace Hugh Longbourne Callendar Who Held The Chair Of Macdonald Professor Of Physics And Was Coming To Cambridge. Rutherford Was Accepted, Which Meant That In 1900 He Could Marry Mary Georgina Newton (1876 - 1954) To Whom He Had Become Engaged Before Leaving New Zealand; They Married At St Paul's Anglican Church, Papanui In Christchurch, They Had One Daughter, Eileen Mary (1901 - 1930), Who Married Ralph Fowler. In 1901, He Gained A Dsc From The University Of New Zealand. In 1907, Rutherford Returned To Britain To Take The Chair Of Physics At The Victoria University Of Manchester. He Was Knighted In 1914. During World War I, He Worked On A Top Secret Project To Solve The Practical Problems Of Submarine Detection By Sonar. In 1916, He Was Awarded The Hector Memorial Medal. In 1919, He Returned To The Cavendish Succeeding J. J. Thomson As The Cavendish Professor And Director. Under Him, Nobel Prizes Were Awarded To James Chadwick For Discovering The Neutron (in 1932), John Cockcroft And Ernest Walton For An Experiment Which Was To Be Known As Splitting The Atom Using A Particle Accelerator, And Edward Appleton For Demonstrating The Existence Of The Ionosphere. In 1925, Rutherford Pushed Calls To The Government Of New Zealand To Support Education And Research, Which Led To The Formation Of The Department Of Scientific And Industrial Research (dsir) In The Following Year. Between 1925 And 1930, He Served As President Of The Royal Society, And Later As President Of The Academic Assistance Council Which Helped Almost 1,000 University Refugees From Germany. He Was Appointed To The Order Of Merit In The 1925 New Year Honours And Raised To The Peerage As Baron Rutherford Of Nelson, Of Cambridge In The County Of Cambridge In 1931, A Title That Became Extinct Upon His Unexpected Death In 1937. In 1933, Rutherford Was One Of The Two Inaugural Recipients Of The T. K. Sidey Medal, Set Up By The Royal Society Of New Zealand As An Award For Outstanding Scientific Research. For Some Time Before His Death, Rutherford Had A Small Hernia, Which He Had Neglected To Have Fixed, And It Became Strangulated, Causing Him To Be Violently Ill. Despite An Emergency Operation In London, He Died Four Days Afterwards Of What Physicians Termed "intestinal Paralysis", At Cambridge. After Cremation At Golders Green Crematorium, He Was Given The High Honour Of Burial In Westminster Abbey, Near Isaac Newton And Other Illustrious British Scientists.
